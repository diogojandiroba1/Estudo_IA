Some potential risks to be aware of include:\n","\n","1. Interest Rate Risk: Treasury securities are subject to interest rate risk, meaning that the value of the bond can fluctuate based on changes in interest rates. When interest rates rise, the value of existing bonds can decrease, and vice versa.\n","\n","2. Inflation Risk: Treasury securities may be vulnerable to inflation risk, as higher inflation can erode the purchasing power of the fixed interest payments received from these bonds.\n","\n","3. Reinvestment Risk: If you rely on the interest payments from Treasury securities for income and interest rates decline when the bond matures, you may not be able to reinvest the proceeds at the same rate.\n","\n","4. Credit Risk: While U.S. Treasury securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, there is still a minimal amount of credit risk associated with them. Other types of bonds issued by corporations or municipalities may carry higher credit risk.\n","\n","5. Liquidity Risk: In times of market stress or volatility, it may be challenging to sell Treasury securities quickly without incurring a loss.\n","\n","Overall, Treasury securities are considered relatively low risk compared to other types of investments, but it's important to understand and consider these potential risks before investing in them.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"ufbs_KeQ15DH","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1744325161733,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Fernando Amaral","userId":"13956145547499510680"}}},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[]}]}
